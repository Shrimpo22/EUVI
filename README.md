# ReFood SMM - Prototype Application

This repository contains the prototype of an application developed for **ReFood Santa Maria Maior (SMM)**, as part of an academic project at **ISCTE**. The main goal is to optimize the daily operations of the ReFood initiative, which focuses on reducing food waste and supporting vulnerable families in the community.

## Project Objectives:
- Improve communication and coordination between volunteers and managers.
- Reduce human errors and streamline task management.
- Provide useful statistics (e.g., number of meals served, volunteer activity).
- Facilitate food collection, preparation, and distribution processes.

## Key Features:
- **Shift Calendar**: Manage and view food collection and distribution schedules.
- **Volunteer Dashboard**: Track volunteer hours and engagement.
- **Impact Reports**: Visualize key statistics such as meals delivered and food waste reduction.
- **Task Guidance**: Step-by-step instructions to assist volunteers in preparing and distributing meals.
- **Beneficiary Management**: Track recipient information, including dietary restrictions.

## Methodology:
The app prototype was developed based on user research, including surveys and interviews with ReFood volunteers and managers. User testing was conducted to improve usability, ensuring the application meets the real needs of the ReFood SMM team.
